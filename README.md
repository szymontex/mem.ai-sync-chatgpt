# Chatgpt to mem.ai clone

This repository contains two main scripts: `chatgpt1.py` and `chatgpt2.py`. Below is a description of each script and instructions on how to run them.

## Prerequisites

1. **Exporting ChatGPT Data**: Before using these scripts, you need to export your entire ChatGPT data from OpenAI. This can be done by logging into your OpenAI account, navigating to settings, and using the export option.

2. **API Access Token**: Ensure you have generated your `ApiAccessToken` from [mem.ai](https://mem.ai/flows/api). For more details on the API and its usage, refer to the [official mem.ai documentation](https://docs.mem.ai).
